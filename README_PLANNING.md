## 📋 The 8 Proposed Learning Methods

### 🏆 Phase 1: Quick Wins (Recommended Start)
1. **⌨️ Typing Mode** (2-3 hours) - Type romanji directly
2. **⚡ Speed Challenge** (4-6 hours) - Timed quiz with combos
3. **🃏 Memory Game** (8-12 hours) - Match characters with romanji

### 📚 Phase 2: Advanced Learning
4. **🔁 Spaced Repetition** (12-16 hours) - Smart review scheduling
5. **🔊 Audio Mode** (8-12 hours) - Pronunciation practice

### 🎨 Phase 3: Content & Context

## 🚀 Getting Started

### If you want to implement immediately:

1. **Read QUICK_SUMMARY.md** (5 min)
2. **Scan DECISION_MATRIX.md** (10 min)
3. **Start with Typing Mode**:
   - See LEARNING_METHODS_PLAN.md → "1. Typing Mode"
   - See UI_MOCKUPS.md → "1. Typing Mode"
   - Time: 2-3 hours
   - No database changes needed

### If you want to plan thoroughly first:

1. **Read all documents in order**:
   - QUICK_SUMMARY.md
   - DECISION_MATRIX.md
   - LEARNING_METHODS_PLAN.md
   - UI_MOCKUPS.md

2. **Make decisions**:
   - Which phase to implement?
   - Which features within that phase?
   - What's the timeline?
   - Who's working on it?

3. **Create tasks**:
   - Break down chosen features into GitHub Issues
   - Assign to developers
   - Set milestones
   - Begin development

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A**: Start with **QUICK_SUMMARY.md** for a 5-minute overview.

### Q: Do we need to implement all 8 features?
**A**: No! Start with Phase 1 (3 features) or even just one. See DECISION_MATRIX.md for guidance.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**: 
- Phase 1: 15-20 hours (2-3 weeks part-time)
- Phase 2: 20-28 hours (3-4 weeks part-time)
- Phase 3: 24-32 hours (3-4 weeks part-time)
- Phase 4: 20-30 hours (3-4 weeks part-time)

### Q: What's the recommended starting point?
**A**: Implement **Typing Mode** first (2-3 hours) as a proof of concept, then add Speed Challenge and Memory Game to complete Phase 1.

### Q: Will this break existing functionality?
**A**: No! All new features are additive. The current quiz mode remains unchanged.

### Q: What's the expected impact?
**A**: After Phase 1, expect 30%+ increase in daily active users and 50%+ increase in session duration.

### Q: Do we need any external services?
**A**: Not for Phase 1-3! Everything uses existing infrastructure (React, Convex, Clerk).

### Q: Can we implement features in a different order?
**A**: Yes! Each feature is independent. See DECISION_MATRIX.md for alternative approaches.

### Q: What if users don't like the new modes?
**A**: The original quiz mode stays as default. Users can opt-in to try new modes. Low risk!

### Q: Is there a mobile version planned?
**A**: All features are responsive and work on mobile. See UI_MOCKUPS.md for mobile views.

### Q: How do we measure success?
**A**: See LEARNING_METHODS_PLAN.md → "Metrics & Success Criteria" for detailed KPIs.
